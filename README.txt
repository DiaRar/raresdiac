This build may work on newer versions of Minecraft, but support is not guaranteed.

You may prefer to use a development build, which you can find at https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html.
Development builds often contain newer features and receive bug fixes quicker than SpigotMC releases.

The main EssentialsX core plugin is required, but the additional modules are optional.
You do not need to install them if you don't need those features.
For more information about each module's features, see https://essentialsx.net/wiki/Module-Breakdown.html.
In general, we recommend installing EssentialsX, EssentialsX Chat and EssentialsX Spawn, as these are the most useful for most servers.

NOTE: EssentialsX XMPP is no longer included in the SpigotMC distribution of EssentialsX.
You can download EssentialsX XMPP from the development builds link above.
